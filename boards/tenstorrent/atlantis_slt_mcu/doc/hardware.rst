Atlantis SLT BMC Hardware Reference
***********************************

This document maps the STM32F746ZGT6 pins to board signals on the
Tenstorrent Atlantis SLT board, based on the schematic Rev 0.997 (sheet 32
"STM32" and the sheets it references), and records what WallaBMC does with
them. Schematic signal names are used throughout; sheet numbers refer to
Rev 0.997.

**Schematic**: Atlantis SLT Rev 0.997 (CoreLab, 2026-10-08). The Tenstorrent
board review (ticket IPS-1761) is the source for the power-good and OTP
handshake requirements quoted below.

MCU overview
============

- **MCU**: STM32F746ZGT6 (U23, LQFP144), Cortex-M7 at 216 MHz, 1 MB flash,
  256 KB SRAM + 64 KB DTCM
- **Supply**: P3V3 from U50 (TPS548B28, 12 V to 3.3 V). U50 is enabled by a
  fixed divider, so the MCU is powered whenever 12 V is present and cannot
  power itself off. ATX standby power for the BMC was deferred to the EVB.
- **Clocks**: 8 MHz crystal Y12 (HSE), 32.768 kHz crystal Y13 (LSE, not yet
  enabled: the RTC runs from LSI until the crystal is verified)
- **RTC backup**: VBAT is the raw CR1220 coin cell in J62 (no diode-OR to
  3.3 V), shared with the SoC-side S35390A RTC on sheet 35. Without a cell
  the MCU RTC loses time on every power cycle.
- **BOOT0**: header J69. Jumper 1-2 boots from flash, 2-3 selects the ST
  system bootloader, no jumper leaves BOOT0 floating.
- **Reset**: button B3 on NRST
- **Board ID**: PD10/PD11 strapped low on SLT ("STM32ID: 00")

M24-M32 on sheet 53. The eFuse enable from U42 ADBUS4 is behind the
unpopulated 0R link R814. PC13 is unconnected. PA15 and PB4 have 4.7K
pull-ups only.

Ethernet
========

- **PHY**: TI DP83826E (U25) in BASIC pin mode, 25 MHz crystal, RJ45 J20
- **Interface**: MII (straps "100M Auto negotiation / MII MAC mode / Full
  Duplex"). RX_ER, CRS and COL are not wired to the MCU; fine for full
  duplex.
- **MDIO address**: no address straps are fitted, so the address is the
  datasheet default. SNLS647I rev I gives PHY_ADD0 = 1 (RX_D3 has an
  internal pull-up) so the DTS uses address 1. Older datasheet revisions
  and app note SNLA338A say 0. **Verify at bring-up** by reading
  PHYIDR1/PHYIDR2 (0x2000/0xA131) at addresses 0 and 1; a wrong address
  logs "No PHY found" and leaves the BMC without network.
- **Reset**: ETH_RSTN (PE3), active low, 4.7K pull-up. The DTS asserts it
  for 100 us and waits 5 ms before the first MDIO access, per the datasheet.
- **Interrupt**: ETH_MII_INTR (PE4), open drain, active low, 4.7K pull-up.
  Not in the DTS: the generic ``ethernet-phy`` driver polls.
- **ModeSelect caveat**: pin 1 is pulled down through 4.7K (R679) instead
  of being shorted to ground as the datasheet asks. If the internal pull-up
  is the 10K used on strap pins, the node sits near 1.06 V, between the
  bootstrap VIL and VIH, so the mode is not guaranteed; measure it. In
  ENHANCED mode the MII and address straps give the same result, pin 21
  becomes PWRDN/INT (held high by R225) and pin 31 a 25 MHz CLKOUT on the
  LED1 net.

Host console UART mux
=====================

SoC UART0 and UART1 are 1.8 V signals level shifted by U89 and then routed
by two SN74CB3Q3253 muxes (U82 for UART0, U83 for UART1) that share the
select lines:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - SEL1 (PD14) : SEL0 (PD15)
     - UART0 / UART1 connected to
   * - 0 0
     - SoC-side FT4232 U73 channels C / D (USB-C J71)
   * - 0 1
     - MCU USART2 / USART3
   * - 1 0
     - Headers J77 / J78 (1 TX in, 2 RX out, 3 3V3, 4 GND)
   * - 1 1
     - nothing (SoC RX lines float)

Both lines have 4.7K pull-ups and a DIP switch (SW4) that grounds them
through 499R when ON. WallaBMC hogs SEL1 low and drives SEL0 high as
``host-console-uart-muxsel`` at init, so while the BMC runs the SoC
console (UART0) is on the console logger, console bridge (TCP port 22) and
web terminal, and the USB channels see nothing. The MCU pushes about 7 mA
into a closed SW4 section; set SW4 OFF when the BMC owns the selects.

SoC reset
=========

SYS_RSTN_3V3 (PG5) and FT4232__SYS_RSTN_3V3 (U73 ADBUS4) are diode-ORed
into Q1, which pulls the SoC RESETN low: **either input high asserts
reset**. R589 pulls PG5 high, so the SoC is held in reset whenever the MCU
is unpowered, in reset, or has not configured the pin. WallaBMC maps the
pin as ``reset-gpio-1`` with ``GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH``. ``reset_init()`` drives
it high at BMC boot, so the SoC stays in reset until ``power on`` releases
it after the last sequence step. ``power off`` asserts it before the rails
drop, and ``reset`` pulses it for one second while the host is on. SYS_RSTN
also asserts PERST# on the three PCIe slots through D9-D11. RESETN has an
internal pull-up in the SoC.

U73 ADBUS4 has no series resistor or pull-down. It is DTR# in the
FT4232H's default UART mode and sits high unless the host actively drives
it low (a port open with DTR asserted, or an MPSSE layout with that bit
low), so a USB-C cable on J71 to an idle host can hold the SoC in reset
no matter what PG5 does. See Known issues.

Power
=====

What comes up by itself
-----------------------

ATX 12 V (J30) passes fuse F1 and the TPS259830 eFuse U54 (UVLO about
10.8 V, ILIM 18 A) to P12V ("12V Ready" LED DS3), and U50 makes P3V3 for
the MCU, PHY and the QSPI flash. Both FT4232H bridges (U42 on J39, U73 on
J71) run from their own USB VBUS, so they enumerate with or without 12 V.
The eFuse enable is reachable only from push-button B1 and the SoC-side
FT4232 U73 (BDBUS7, R816 fitted) through MOSFET Q12, so **BDBUS7 high
disables the eFuse**; the MCU-side path R814 is not populated. ATX PS_ON
is a jumper on J31. So the MCU cannot power-cycle the board or itself:
"power off" means dropping the SoC rails.

SoC rails controlled by the MCU
-------------------------------

Every enable has a pull-down, so all of these rails stay off until the
firmware drives them. Documented order (schematic sheet 56):
P12V > P3V3 > P5V > VCORE_0V8 > DVDD_3V3 / DDR / PCIe, with LPDDR5
VDD1 > VDD2 > 0.9 V > VDDQ (sheet 44).

Steps 3 to 8 follow the sheet 56 graph, which does not order the MPM54304,
DDR and PCIe groups relative to each other; that order must come from the
SoC power-sequencing specification.

Constraints from the board review (IPS-1761): OTP_PWRRDY, PWR1_GD and
PWR2_GD must be driven low before DVDD_1V8 ramps and asserted only once
VDD/VDDIO are good (200 ns setup for PWRRDY). No inter-rail delays are
documented anywhere; the SoC power-sequencing specification is still
outstanding. The VCORE enable reaches the regulators through jumper J17.
As drawn, the printed default ("3-4 short") would tie CNTL to ground, so
STM32 control needs the VCORE_0V8_EN pin (2 as drawn) linked to a CNTL
pin; check the real header.

The rails are the ``wallabmc,power-rail`` nodes in
``boards/atlantis_slt_mcu.overlay``; ``power-on-sequence`` in its
``power_sequencer`` node lists them in the table's order and
``power-off-sequence`` in the reverse. ``power on`` walks the on sequence.
SYS_RSTN is asserted first.
Each step waits for its required power-good inputs to read low (a power
good that is already high before its enable cannot be trusted), asserts
the enable, waits for the inputs to read high and then sleeps the step's
settle time. PWR_GOOD_5V gates step 1, PG_PH1 step 2, MPM54304_GPIO
step 3, PWR_GOOD_LPDDR5 step 4 and PWR_GOOD_0V9 step 5. PG_PH1 is the
primary TPS546E25's power good and is required so that a VCORE that never
starts stops the sequence instead of letting the IO rails, the handshakes
and the reset release go ahead with no core supply; the TPS546E25
datasheet says PG is actively pulled low while CNTL is low with VCC
present, so the low reading before the enable is a valid check. PG_PH2 is
``power-good-optional`` on step 2: it is not checked before the enable and
a timeout logs ``VCORE_0V8_EN: optional PG_PH2 not good after 1000 ms``
and continues, because the TPS546E25 datasheet does not say what the
secondary device's PG pin does in a stacked pair (see Known issues). If
the LED DS2 clamp makes PC7 read low while VCORE is fine, step 2 fails
with ``VCORE_0V8_EN: PG_PH1 not good after 1000 ms`` and backs out; VCORE
is up for that second, long enough to measure PC7. The fix is to remove
or buffer DS2, or to move ``pg_ph1`` to ``power-good-optional`` in the
overlay, which leaves VCORE ungated. Steps 6 to 11 have no power-good
input. Every wait allows 1 s (``power-good-timeout-ms``, polled each
millisecond). The settle times are 1 ms after VDDQ and 5 ms after each
PCIe rail, nothing elsewhere; they cover the regulators' own soft-start
and are placeholders until the SoC power-sequencing specification gives
real numbers. After step 11 the sequencer releases SYS_RSTN, marks the
host on and logs ``System Power State changed to: ON``; each step also
logs ``<ENABLE> on`` at debug level, where ``<ENABLE>`` is the enable's
DTS label.

A step that times out logs ``<ENABLE>: <PG> still good after 1000 ms`` or
``<ENABLE>: <PG> not good after 1000 ms``, then ``Power on failed at
<ENABLE>, powering off``: the rails that came up are taken down in
``power-off-sequence`` order as for ``power off``, SYS_RSTN stays
asserted and the error is returned to the shell or Redfish. ``power off``
asserts SYS_RSTN and walks the off sequence, the reverse of power on.
Steps 11 to 2 drop with no delay; step 1
has ``off-delay-ms`` 100, so P5V stays up for 100 ms after the SoC
regulator enables have dropped. The TPS51488 is powered from P5V and
needs it while it shuts down: it drops VDD2 as soon as DDR_VDD_EN goes
low and holds VDD1 for 30 to 60 ms before discharging it (TPS51488
datasheet). Power off therefore takes about 100 ms. Among the SoC rails
the order is by enable only and is not timed; the real collapse order is
set by the regulators and the load. ``power on`` with the host already on
and ``power off`` with it already off do nothing and log ``System Power
State already: ON`` (or ``OFF``) instead of ``changed to``. Power cycle is
off, 2 s, on. One mutex serialises the shell, Redfish and the boot-time
auto power-on (``config host auto_poweron``), so they cannot interleave.
The host power state is not persisted across BMC reboots: a BMC reset
powers the host off, and the sequence runs at boot only when auto power-on
is enabled. MCUboot's devicetree carries the rail nodes too (the
sysbuild build shares the application's bindings) but MCUboot has no
code for them, so only the gpio-hogs act and every enable stays low until
the application runs.

**Thermal trip**: TJ_MAX_3V3 (PG0, ``tj_max``) is the SoC's junction
over-temperature output, listed as a ``fault`` of the ``power_sequencer``
node. It comes through U61 (see Level shifters): it floats until DVDD_1V8 is
up and reads high through the shifter's pull-up whenever the SoC does not
drive it, presumably in reset too (undocumented, see Known issues), so the
sequencer does not act on its level. After the last step, once SYS_RSTN is
released, it arms a rising-edge interrupt on PG0 and disarms it again before
``power off`` or ``reset`` asserts SYS_RSTN. Every rising edge logs
``TJ_MAX_3V3 asserted, powering off`` and runs the normal power off from a
thread of its own (the system work queue can be busy with NTP for seconds):
the handshakes and the SoC enables drop within about a millisecond, P5V 100
ms later, and ``System Power State changed to: OFF`` follows. ``power on``
brings the host back. The edge is not qualified by reading the line again,
because a SoC that resets itself on a trip may stop driving the pin at once.
PG0 already high when it is armed logs ``TJ_MAX_3V3 asserted at reset
release`` and does not stop the power on, since that is what the pull-up
gives before the SoC drives the pin; an alarm already active then is not
seen until it drops and returns. The polarity is an assumption (see Known
issues). A pin-0 EXTI line is needed, so no other PA0 to PK0 interrupt can
be added while ``tj_max`` is a fault.

PMIC I2C
--------

The regulators share one I2C/PMBus bus (schematic I2C4): TPS546E25 at
0x0D (PMBus), TPS628681 at 0x49, TPS628682 at 0x41, MPM54304 at 0x68.
Headers J67 (SCL) and J68 (SDA) select the master: 1-2 puts the MCU's I2C5
(STM32 ``i2c4``, PD12/PD13) on the bus, 2-3 the SoC's I2C4. The pull-ups
R179/R180 to the TPS546E25 4.4 V LDO are not fitted (the MPM54304 pins are
rated to 4 V), so in the 1-2 position the only pull-ups are the MCU-side
R204/R205 (4.7K to P3V3) and in the 2-3 position only the U67 shifter's
internal ones while DVDD_1V8 is up.

JTAG
====

Two SoC TAPs, each behind SN74CB3Q3253 muxes with the same select
encoding as the UART mux (SEL1:SEL0 00 FT4232 U73, 01 MCU, 10 header,
11 none) and a DIP switch that forces 00 when ON:

WallaBMC's ``jtagtck``/``jtagtms``/``jtagtdi``/``jtagtdo`` aliases point at
JTAG0. The select lines are not driven by the firmware yet. With both SW2
sections OFF the selects idle at 11 and no source reaches the SoC, so until
``jtag.c`` drives PA6 low and PA5 high on client connect, give JTAG0 to the
MCU by hand: SW2 section on SEL1 ON, section on SEL0 OFF. Hogging the
selects was avoided because it would cut the USB JTAG path that bring-up
relies on.

Boot flash and SD muxes
=======================

- **QSPI**: the 16 MiB MX25L12833F (U19) sits behind TS3A27518E U21.
  EN (PE5) is pulled up, so the flash is isolated from everyone until the
  MCU drives it low; IN1/IN2 (PE6/PE7) both low route it to the SoC, both
  high to the MCU QUADSPI. Never drive IN1 and IN2 differently (it splits
  the bus). WallaBMC hogs all three low so the SoC can boot from NOR as
  soon as it is released from reset, in MCUboot as well as the app. The
  ``quadspi`` node is defined but disabled; programming the flash from the
  BMC is a follow-up.
- **SD**: slot S1 is wired straight to SoC SDIO0 (the MCU sees only its
  card detect on PA8). Slot S2 is behind U20 with the same control scheme
  (PE8 EN, PG3/PG4 IN); WallaBMC hogs them low so S2 belongs to SoC SDIO1.
  U20, both slots and their pull-ups are on DVDD_3V3 and are dead until
  MPM54304 is enabled, so the card-detect inputs read low until then.

Level shifters
==============

All TXS0108E/TXS0102 shifters between the SoC and the MCU have their OE
pulled to DVDD_1V8. Until MPM54304 is enabled, TJ_MAX_3V3 and
GPIO2/8/11/12_3V3 are undriven on the MCU side; firmware must ignore them
until DVDD_1V8 is up, and must not add pull-downs (they would fight the
shifters' internal pull-ups once enabled). Those pull-ups also make
TJ_MAX_3V3 read high whenever the SoC does not drive it, so the
sequencer acts only on its edges (see Power).

PWR1_GD, PWR2_GD and OTP_PWRRDY do not go through a shifter: 15K/18K
dividers (R864-R867 on sheet 46, R870/R871 on sheet 47) replace the
unfitted 0R links into U61/U85, so the SoC sees 1.8 V when the
MCU drives 3.3 V and 0 V when the pin is low or floating (MCU unpowered or
in reset). The pins must be push-pull: open drain would never reach a
high. The shifters' B ports stay attached to the 3.3 V nets, so once
DVDD_1V8 is up their internal pull-ups lift a floating pin to about 1.5 V
at the SoC; the gpio-hogs keep the three pins driven low from boot, in
MCUboot and the app, and ``power_init()`` reconfigures them as push-pull
outputs, still low, until steps 9 to 11 of the sequence raise them.

Known issues
============

None of these is fixed by firmware; the TJ_MAX entries need a
measurement before the DTS can be settled.

- **PG_PH1 level** (sheet 41): the TPS546E25 PG output is pulled up by
  R178 10K to the ~4.4 V LDO but also feeds LED DS2 through R185 1K, so
  when PG releases the node sits at the LED forward voltage plus a little,
  roughly 2 V (the LED part is not on the schematic). That is between the
  STM32's design-guaranteed VIH of 1.8 V and its production-tested 2.3 V,
  so PC7 may read low or be noisy while VCORE is fine.
  PG_PH2 has no LED and is unaffected. The sequencer lists ``pg_ph1`` as
  ``power-good`` on step 2 so that a VCORE that never starts stops the
  power on; a bad reading therefore fails step 2 with ``VCORE_0V8_EN:
  PG_PH1 not good after 1000 ms`` and backs the rails out. VCORE is up
  for that second, long enough to measure PC7. The fix is to buffer the
  LED or remove DS2. Until then ``pg_ph1`` can move to
  ``power-good-optional`` in ``boards/atlantis_slt_mcu.overlay``, which
  leaves VCORE ungated.
- **PG_PH2 in the stacked pair**: the TPS546E25 datasheet does not say
  what the secondary device's PG pin does when two are stacked (over PMBus
  a secondary always reports power good), so ``pg_ph2`` is
  ``power-good-optional`` until it is measured. If PC6 follows VCORE, move
  it to ``power-good`` so both phases gate the step.
- **SoC held in reset by the USB bridge** (sheets 8, 55): U73 ADBUS4 drives
  the reset OR directly and is DTR#, high unless the host drives it low.
  A J71 cable to a host that has not asserted DTR, or any port close,
  asserts SoC reset. The fix is a pull-down and series resistor, an
  inverted sense, or an EEPROM/host configuration that keeps ADBUS4 low.
- **12 V eFuse and the USB bridge** (sheets 40, 55): with Q12 the eFuse is
  disabled when BDBUS7 is high, and BDBUS7 is RI# with the FT4232H's
  internal pull-up when nothing drives it. Its gate then sits around
  1.9 V, above the BSS138 threshold, so 12 V may stay off or drop while
  J71 is attached to an idle host. Measure P12V with J71 plugged in; a
  smaller R877 or a Schmitt buffer fixes it.
- **TJ_MAX polarity** (sheet 5): nothing documents the SoC's TJ_MAX pin.
  The sequencer assumes it is driven high while the junction is at its
  maximum temperature and low otherwise. ``TJ_MAX_3V3 asserted at reset
  release`` on every ``power on`` means the SoC had not started driving the
  pin when SYS_RSTN was released (U61's pull-up) or the alarm is
  active low; in the second case the host would be powered off when the
  alarm clears, not when it starts, and ``tj_max`` in
  ``atlantis_mcu.dtsi`` needs ``GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW``. Measure PG0 with the
  SoC running.
- **TJ_MAX while the SoC is reset behind the BMC's back** (sheets 8, 46):
  when U73 ADBUS4 resets the SoC with the host on (see above), a SoC
  that stops driving TJ_MAX lets U61's pull-up raise PG0, which the
  sequencer would take as a trip. Measure PG0 with the SoC held in reset
  by DTR#; if it rises, a J71 event ends in a power off until the reset
  path is fixed.

Bring-up checklist
==================

#. Read the PHY ID at MDIO addresses 0 and 1 and fix ``reg`` on
   ``eth_phy`` if needed; measure U25 pin 1 to learn BASIC vs ENHANCED mode.
#. Confirm SW2/SW3/SW4 positions, the J17 jumper, and J67/J68.
#. Fit a CR1220 in J62 if the RTC should keep time.
#. Enable ``clk_lse`` and switch ``rtc`` to ``STM32_SRC_LSE RTC_SEL(1)``
   on a test build. If Y13 does not start, the STM32 clock driver spins
   waiting for it and neither MCUboot nor the app prints anything; raise
   ``driving-capability`` on ``clk_lse`` in that case. Make it the default
   once it boots.
#. Check the FT4232 channel A SWD path programs the MCU; J61 is the
   fallback.
#. Run ``power on`` and watch the console: ``System Power State changed
   to: ON`` means all eleven steps passed; ``Power on failed at <ENABLE>,
   powering off`` names the first rail whose power good did not rise
   (``<PG> not good``) or was already high (``<PG> still good``). The
   per-step ``<ENABLE> on`` lines are at debug level.
#. With the host running, read PG0 (TJ_MAX_3V3): it must be low and
   ``power on`` must not have logged ``TJ_MAX_3V3 asserted at reset
   release``; if it did, see Known issues. If the SoC can be made to
   raise TJ_MAX, check the BMC logs ``TJ_MAX_3V3 asserted, powering off``
   followed by ``System Power State changed to: OFF``. Also read PG0 with
   the SoC held in reset through J71 (Known issues). If the host powers
   off on its own with ``TJ_MAX_3V3 asserted`` in the log and the SoC
   was not hot, drop ``fault`` from ``power_sequencer`` in
   ``boards/atlantis_slt_mcu.overlay`` until the cause is found.
#. Measure PG_PH1 at PC7 and PG_PH2 at PC6 with VCORE on. PG_PH1 is
   required: if PC7 stays low, step 2 fails with ``VCORE_0V8_EN: PG_PH1
   not good after 1000 ms`` after holding VCORE up for 1 s, long enough
   to measure. Fix DS2, or move ``pg_ph1`` to ``power-good-optional`` on
   the ``vcore_0v8`` step in ``boards/atlantis_slt_mcu.overlay``, which
   leaves VCORE ungated. PG_PH2 only warns; move it to ``power-good`` if
   PC6 follows VCORE.
#. Check MPM54304_GPIO (PF10) reads low before MPM54304_EN and high
   after it. The MPM54304 datasheet says the GPIO pin in PG mode is
   pulled low while EN is low or in UVLO, so step 3 failing with
   ``MPM54304_EN: MPM54304_GPIO still good after 1000 ms`` means U53 has
   no input or the fitted MTP does not configure the GPIO pin as PG;
   ``not good`` means the rails never came up.
#. Scope SYS_RSTN across ``power on`` and ``power off``: it must stay high
   until OTP_PWRRDY has risen and go high again before the enables drop.
#. Measure SYS_RSTN and P12V with a USB-C cable on J71 to an idle host
   (Known issues).

Feature work
============

#. Monitor the power-good inputs while the host is on and act on a loss
   (power off, or at least report it); today they are read only during
   ``power on``.
#. Timed power-off order once the SoC power-sequencing specification
   gives numbers; today the enables drop in reverse order with only the
   100 ms P5V off delay.
#. Persist the host power state across BMC reboots so the host can be
   brought back after a BMC reset, which powers it off.
#. Drive the JTAG mux selects from the JTAG daemon.
#. TMP117 and EEPROM support on ``i2c2`` (board temperature, identity).
#. PMBus telemetry over ``i2c4`` when J67/J68 give the bus to the MCU.
#. QSPI flash programming and SD slot S2 access through the muxes.
#. RTC on the LSE crystal once Y13 is verified.
#. Report the fault inputs and the last trip in the shell and Redfish.
